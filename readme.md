# Code-Challenge-1

This was the first 90 minute coding challenge at Prime. We were tasked with creating a simple webpage that had a button to append new divs, within wich would be a count of how many times the button was clicked, as well as a "Swap" and "Delete" button. The "Swap" button changes the background color, and the "Delete" button deletes the div.
